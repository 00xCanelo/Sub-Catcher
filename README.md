# 00xCanelo Sub Catcher


[Extension Icon: Icons/icon128.png]

## Overview

Sub Catcher is a Chrome extension designed to help security researchers, pentesters, and bug bounty hunters automatically extract and collect subdomains related to a target domain from SecurityTrails ([https://securitytrails.com](https://securitytrails.com/)). It parses SecurityTrails domain and DNS pages, compiles unique subdomains, and lets you download the results as a text file.

## Features

- Auto-detects the target domain from SecurityTrails URLs.
- Crawls up to 100 pages of subdomain listings with built-in delay and retry logic.
- Handles HTTP 429 (rate limiting) gracefully by waiting before retrying.
- Collects unique subdomains in a set to avoid duplicates.
- Provides progress logs visible in the extension popup.
- Exports the full list of discovered subdomains as a `.txt` file.
- Stores progress and count data using Chrome's local storage.
